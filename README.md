# simple-node-docker
Deploying a simple Node JS application, created using Express and Bootstrap, using Docker


This Node JS Application was built to demonstrate the creation of a simple web application that can server static pages as well.
Eventually the application and its dependencies are packaged into a Dockerfile for delivery.
You can refer to the docker-compose file for setting up the app with custom volume and network.
